# The S1 Project

It still happens to me (after almost a decade of owning S4's) that I'm accidentally controlling the wrong deck (C/D instead of A/B) because I misread the deck switch button.

The "toggle" style button doesn't allow you to build muscle memory and when things need to be done quickly this becomes a major pain in the ass (it should have been a big chunky flip-style toggle).

So after 8 years of thinking about it, I finally bought an extra S4. The MK1's are really affordable second-hand these days.

When I opened it up I was pretty happy to see they used a neatly panelized PCB design, I tend to waaaaaaay overengineer things so now I could just leave the PCB on, cut the traces on it, and connect the components to my own PCB.
